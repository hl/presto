# Presto Overview

Presto is a high-performance RETE rules engine for Elixir, designed with **Best Simple System for Now (BSSN)** principles to provide a lean yet powerful solution for complex business rule processing with native aggregation support.

## What is Presto?

Presto implements the RETE algorithm - a sophisticated pattern matching algorithm widely used in expert systems and business rule engines. It efficiently matches patterns against large sets of facts by building a network that incrementally processes changes.

### Key Characteristics

- **Production-Ready**: Built for real-world applications with comprehensive monitoring and error handling
- **High-Performance**: Incremental processing with O(1) aggregation updates for efficient handling of large fact sets
- **BSSN Architecture**: Simplified 8-module design following "Best Simple System for Now" principles
- **Native Aggregations**: Built-in support for sum, count, avg, min, max, and collect operations
- **Explicit API**: Clean Elixir functions without DSL complexity
- **Fault Tolerant**: Robust supervision tree with graceful error recovery

## Best Simple System for Now (BSSN)

Presto's architecture embodies the **Best Simple System for Now** philosophy:

### Core BSSN Principles
- **Simplicity First**: Build the simplest system that meets current needs
- **Quality Standards**: Maintain appropriate quality without over-engineering
- **Explicit over Magic**: Clear, explicit APIs over DSL complexity
- **Focused Modules**: Each module has a single, well-defined responsibility

### BSSN Implementation in Presto
- **Module Consolidation**: Reduced from 11 to 8 core modules by eliminating unnecessary abstractions
- **Direct Integration**: Consolidated related functionality to reduce inter-process communication overhead
- **Explicit Helpers**: `Presto.Rule` module provides clear functions instead of complex configuration
- **Unified Memory Management**: Single cohesive approach instead of distributed memory handling

## Architecture

Presto follows a simplified architecture with 8 focused modules organized into logical groups:

    style F fill:#f3e5f5
```

- **Presto.Rule**: Explicit helper functions for rule construction and validation
- **Utils**: Shared utilities and helper functions

### Example Modules (3)
- **OvertimeRules**: Payroll overtime calculation rules
- **TroncRules**: Hospitality TRONC distribution rules  
- **Examples**: General demonstration rules

### Module Responsibilities

| Module | Responsibility | BSSN Benefit |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| **RuleEngine** | RETE algorithm, alpha network, working memory, rule analysis | Consolidated functionality reduces message passing |
| **BetaNetwork** | Join operations and native aggregations | Unified approach to both joins and aggregations |
| **Presto.Rule** | Explicit rule construction helpers | Clear API without DSL complexity |
| **Logger** | Structured monitoring and debugging | Focused logging responsibility |

## RETE-Native Aggregations

One of Presto's key differentiators is its native support for aggregations within the RETE network itself.

### Supported Aggregation Functions
- **`:sum`** - Sum numeric values
- **`:count`** - Count matching facts
- **`:avg`** - Calculate average of numeric values
- **`:min`** - Find minimum value
- **`:max`** - Find maximum value
- **`:collect`** - Collect all matching values into a list

### Aggregation Features
- **Incremental Updates**: O(1) complexity for aggregation updates vs O(N) for manual calculation
- **Multi-field Grouping**: Group by multiple fields for complex aggregations
- **Custom Output Patterns**: Define how aggregation results are structured
- **Integration with Rule Chaining**: Aggregation results can trigger other rules

### Example Aggregation Rule
```elixir
# Calculate total hours worked by employee
weekly_hours = Presto.Rule.aggregation(
  :weekly_hours,
  [Presto.Rule.pattern(:timesheet, [:id, :employee_id, :hours])],
  [:employee_id],  # Group by employee
  :sum,            # Aggregation function
  :hours          # Field to aggregate
)

# Multi-field grouping
sales_by_region_product = Presto.Rule.aggregation(
  :sales_summary,
  [Presto.Rule.pattern(:sale, [:id, :region, :product, :amount])],
  [:region, :product],  # Group by both fields
  :sum,
  :amount
)
```

## Performance Characteristics

# Start engine
{:ok, engine} = Presto.start_engine()

# Bulk operations (BSSN: simple, efficient)
Presto.assert_facts(engine, facts)
Presto.add_rules(engine, rules)

# Execute rules
results = Presto.fire_rules(engine)
```

### Explicit Rule Construction
```elixir
# Standard rule using explicit helpers
rule = Presto.Rule.new(
  :eligibility_rule,
  [
    Presto.Rule.pattern(:employee, [:id, :type, :tenure]),
    Presto.Rule.test(:type, :==, :permanent),
    Presto.Rule.test(:tenure, :>, 90)
  ],
  fn %{id: id} -> [{:eligible, id}] end
)

# Aggregation rule

      MyApp.RuleService.subscribe()
    end
    
    {:ok, assign(socket, metrics: load_metrics())}
  end
  
  def handle_info({:rule_results, results}, socket) do
    # Update dashboard with aggregation results
    metrics = extract_metrics(results)
    {:noreply, assign(socket, metrics: metrics)}
  end
end
```

## Monitoring and Observability

[info] Aggregation updated - aggregation_id: department_totals, groups_affected: 3, update_time: 0.5ms
```

### Integration with Telemetry
```elixir
# Presto emits telemetry events for external monitoring
:telemetry.attach("presto-monitor", 
  [:presto, :rule, :execution],
