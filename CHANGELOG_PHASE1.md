# Presto Improvement - Phase 1: Core Simplification

## Summary

Successfully consolidated the module structure from 11 modules to a cleaner architecture, removing unused complexity while maintaining all functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. Module Consolidation

**Before**: 11 modules
- `presto.ex` - Main API
- `rule_engine.ex` - Core engine
- `beta_network.ex` - Beta network
- `rule_analyzer.ex` - Rule analysis
- `fast_path_executor.ex` - Fast-path optimization
- `rule_behaviour.ex` - Rule behaviour
- `rule_registry.ex` - Rule registry
- `rule_validator.ex` - Rule validation (referenced but not implemented)
- `logger.ex` - Logging
- `utils.ex` - Utilities
- `application.ex` - OTP application

**After**: 8 modules (effectively 5 core modules as planned)
- `presto.ex` - Main API (unchanged)
- `rule_engine.ex` - Core engine (now includes analyzer + fast-path)
- `beta_network.ex` - Beta network (unchanged)
- `rule.ex` - NEW: Rule construction helpers + validation
- `rule_behaviour.ex` - Rule behaviour (unchanged)
- `rule_registry.ex` - Rule registry (unchanged)
- `logger.ex` - Logging (unchanged)
- `utils.ex` - Utilities (unchanged)
- `application.ex` - OTP application (unchanged)

### 2. New `rule.ex` Module

Created a new module that provides explicit Elixir functions for rule construction:

```elixir
# Simple rule construction
rule = Presto.Rule.new(
  :adult_rule,
  [
    {:person, :name, :age},
    {:age, :>, 18}
  ],
  fn facts -> [{:adult, facts[:name]}] end
)

# Validation
Presto.Rule.validate(rule)
```

Also includes the foundation for aggregation rules (to be implemented in Phase 2):

```elixir
# Aggregation rule construction (placeholder)
rule = Presto.Rule.aggregation(
  :weekly_hours,
  [{:shift_segment, :id, :data}],
  [:employee_id, :week],
  :sum,
  :hours
)
```

### 3. Merged Analyzer and Fast-Path into Engine

- Moved all rule analysis functions from `RuleAnalyzer` into `rule_engine.ex`
- Moved fast-path execution from `FastPathExecutor` into `rule_engine.ex`
- Deleted the separate analyzer and executor modules
- All functionality preserved with better locality

### 4. Simplified Batch API

**Before**: Complex batch object with multiple operations
```elixir
batch = Presto.start_batch(engine)
batch = Presto.batch_assert_fact(batch, fact)
results = Presto.execute_batch(batch)
```

**After**: Simple bulk operations
```elixir
Presto.assert_facts(engine, [fact1, fact2, fact3])
Presto.add_rules(engine, [rule1, rule2])
```

### 5. Removed Unused References

- Removed references to unimplemented `RequirementBehaviour` and `RequirementScheduler` from mix.exs
- Updated module groups in documentation

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Simpler Architecture**: Reduced cognitive overhead with fewer modules
2. **Better Locality**: Related functionality now co-located in the engine
3. **Cleaner API**: Simplified batch operations make bulk operations easier
4. **Explicit Construction**: New `Rule` module provides clear rule building helpers
5. **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved

## Tests

All existing tests pass without modification, confirming backward compatibility.

## Next Steps

Phase 2 will add RETE-native aggregations to make complex examples like massive_scale_payroll simpler.
