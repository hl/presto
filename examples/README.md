# Presto Examples

This directory contains simplified, focused examples demonstrating Presto's RETE rules engine capabilities. All examples follow **Best Simple System for Now (BSSN)** principles, providing simple solutions for current demonstration needs without over-engineering.

## Quick Start

All examples can be run directly with mix:

```bash
# Basic introduction to Presto
mix run examples/basic_example.exs

# Learn about RETE-native aggregations
mix run examples/aggregation_example.exs

# See batch processing in action
mix run examples/batch_processing_example.exs

# Explore query interface
mix run examples/query_example.exs

# Learn debugging and introspection
mix run examples/debugging_example.exs

# Explore domain-specific rules (payroll)
mix run -e "Examples.PayrollExample.run_demo()"
```

## Example Overview

### 1. Basic Example (`basic_example.exs`) - **Start Here!**

A gentle introduction to Presto's v0.2 API in ~50 lines. Perfect for beginners.

**Demonstrates:**

Shows how to use RETE-native aggregations for efficient data grouping and computation.

**Demonstrates:**
- RETE-native aggregation rules with `Presto.Rule.aggregation/6`
- Built-in functions: `:sum`, `:count`, `:avg`, `:min`, `:max`, `:collect`
- Custom aggregation functions
- Multi-field grouping

- Concurrent rule processing
- Result analysis and reporting

**Use Cases:**
- Payroll processing for hundreds/thousands of employees
- Transaction processing
- Data migration and validation

### 4. Query Example (`query_example.exs`)

Demonstrates the new query interface for ad-hoc fact exploration without rule execution.

**Demonstrates:**
- Pattern-based fact queries with `query/3`
- Conditional queries with filters
- Multi-table joins with `query_join/3`
- Fact counting with `count_facts/3`
- Fact explanation with `explain_fact/2`
- Query performance measurement

### 5. Debugging Example (`debugging_example.exs`) 

Shows comprehensive debugging and introspection tools for system analysis.

**Demonstrates:**
- Rule inspection with `inspect_rule/2`
- Engine diagnostics with `diagnostics/1`
- Performance profiling with `profile_execution/2`
- Fact tracing with `trace_fact/2`
- Network visualization with `visualize_network/1`
- Performance recommendations

### 6. Payroll Example (`payroll_example.ex`)

Domain-specific example showing real-world business rules for payroll processing.

**Demonstrates:**
- Complex business logic
- Multiple rule interactions
- Practical calculation patterns
- Performance metrics

**Business Rules:**
- Overtime calculations
- Performance bonuses
- Tax deductions
- Holiday pay

## Learning Progression

1. **Start with `basic_example.exs`** - Learn fundamental concepts
2. **Try `aggregation_example.exs`** - Understand RETE-native aggregations
3. **Run `batch_processing_example.exs`** - See performance and scale
4. **Explore `query_example.exs`** - Learn ad-hoc fact querying
5. **Try `debugging_example.exs`** - Master debugging and introspection
6. **Apply `payroll_example.ex`** - See real-world scenarios

## Performance Notes

These examples are optimized for learning, not necessarily for maximum performance. For production use:

- Use longer-lived rule engines (don't create/destroy per operation)
- Consider rule compilation and caching strategies
- Profile your specific use case
- Implement proper error handling and monitoring

## API Reference

All examples use the simplified v0.2 API:

### Core Functions
```elixir
# Engine management
{:ok, engine} = Presto.start_engine()

# Rule creation
rule = Presto.Rule.new(id, conditions, action)
agg_rule = Presto.Rule.aggregation(id, conditions, group_by, func, field)

# Batch operations
:ok = Presto.add_rules(engine, rules)
:ok = Presto.assert_facts(engine, facts)
:ok = Presto.retract_facts(engine, facts)

# Complete batch operations
results = Presto.execute_batch(engine, rules: rules, facts: facts)
{:ok, engine, results} = Presto.create_and_execute(rules: rules, facts: facts)

# Execution
results = Presto.fire_rules(engine)

# Query interface
people = Presto.query(engine, {:person, :_, :_})
count = Presto.count_facts(engine, {:person, :_, :_})

# Monitoring and debugging
stats = Presto.get_rule_statistics(engine)
diagnostics = Presto.diagnostics(engine)
profile = Presto.profile_execution(engine)
```

### Rule Conditions
```elixir
# Pattern matching
Presto.Rule.pattern(:fact_type, [:field1, :field2, :field3])

# Tests
Presto.Rule.test(:variable, :>, value)
Presto.Rule.test(:variable, :==, value)
```

### Aggregations
```elixir
# Built-in aggregation functions
sum_rule = Presto.Rule.aggregation(id, patterns, group_by, :sum, field)
count_rule = Presto.Rule.aggregation(id, patterns, group_by, :count, nil)
avg_rule = Presto.Rule.aggregation(id, patterns, group_by, :avg, field)

# Custom aggregation functions
custom_rule = Presto.Rule.aggregation(
  id, patterns, group_by, 
  fn values -> Enum.max(values) - Enum.min(values) end, 
  field
)

# Windowed aggregations
windowed_rule = Presto.Rule.aggregation(
  id, patterns, group_by, :avg, field,
  window_size: 100
)
```

## Simplified Architecture

These examples demonstrate Presto's BSSN-simplified architecture:

- **8 focused modules** (down from 11)
- **Direct API calls** (no complex abstractions)
- **Explicit over implicit** (clear function calls vs. DSL magic)
- **Simple solutions** (solve current needs without speculation)

## BSSN Principles Applied

1. **Simplicity First**: Each example solves one specific problem clearly
2. **Quality Standards**: Production-ready code without over-engineering
3. **Explicit APIs**: No DSLs or magic - just Elixir functions
4. **Focused Modules**: Each example has a single, clear purpose

## Previous Examples (Removed)

The following over-engineered examples were removed to align with BSSN principles:

- `enhanced_payroll_demo.exs` - Duplicated functionality
- `payroll_aggregator.ex` - Manual aggregations (superseded by native)
- `massive_scale_payroll/` - 8-file abstraction not needed for demonstration

## Performance Benchmarks

Current optimizations provide:

- **~16Î¼s per fact insertion** (measured)
- **Concurrent ETS access** for better throughput
- **Pattern matching optimizations** via direct tuple access
- **ETS-based statistics** replacing process dictionary overhead
